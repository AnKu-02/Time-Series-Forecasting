### Time-Series-Forecasting

This script analyzes a time series dataset of alcohol. It loads the data, sets the date as the index, and creates features representing sales from the past three months. The code trains two models—Linear Regression and Random Forest Regression—and visualizes their predictions against actual sales. The models are evaluated using mean squared error.
